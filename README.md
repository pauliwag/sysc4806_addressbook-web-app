All AddressBooks and BuddyInfos are listed at index.html (i.e., landing page) via Thymeleaf.  I initially save one AddressBook and populate it with a couple BuddyInfos.

Endpoints and path params for POSTing AddressBooks and POSTing/DELETEing BuffyInfos to/from AddressBooks can be seen in the RESTfulController class.
